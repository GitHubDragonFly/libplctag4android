# libplctag4android

An experimental repo with an example Android application using libplctag.

This is a direct copy of the great work done by @GitHubDragonFly with some minor tweaks to use the core C library and the 
libplctag4j Tag.java wrapper unchanged.

TODO:
- [x] Get the working version into Git.
- [x] Make the Gradle build check out the release branch of libplctag from the main C repo when building.
- [x] Get the Android changes back into the main C repo.
- [ ] Make the Gradle build load the NDK.
- [ ] Make the build process work on GitHub Actions.
- [x] Use the libplctag4j Java version or figure out another way to share the Java code part.
- [ ] Documentation!
