# libplctag4android
An experimental repo with an example Android application using libplctag.

This is a direct copy of the great work done by @GitHubDragonFly.

Goals:
- [ ] Get the working version into Git.
- [ ] Make the Gradle build check out the release branch of libplctag from the main C repo when building.
- [ ] Make the Gradle build load the NDK.
- [ ] Make the build process work on GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Use the libplctag4j Java version or figure out another way to share the Java code part.
- [ ] Documentation!
